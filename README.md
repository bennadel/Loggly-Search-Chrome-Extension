# Loggly Search Extension MVP

by [Ben Nadel][bennadel]

A number of years ago, I created a few [Loggly Bookmarklets][bookmarklets] that would improve upon the existing Loggly search page, adding better grid formatting and some automatic JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) parsing. Just recently, however, Loggly implemented a new Content Security Policy (CSP) that doesn't allow my bookmarklet scripts to be injected. As such, I've taken those scripts and packaged them up as this simple Chrome Extension.

This is not an "official" Chrome Extension and is meant to be loaded as an "unpacked" extension directly from my local machine.
